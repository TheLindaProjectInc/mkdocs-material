# Metrixcoin DGP Protocol

Metrix Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP) allows specific blockchain settings to be modified by making use of smart contracts when a voting proposal has been passed. There is a minimum of 100 governors that must be active for any vote to work. This is to minimize the chance of one person having 51% of governors at any time. There is a cap of 1920 governors. 

Each governor is required to stay active by voting or pinging the network at least once a month. Voting only succeeds when 51% of governors have passed a proposal. There is a stricter voting requirement for budget proposals which require 10% greater yes than no votes to pass. Governors will earn the same staking rate for contributing.
